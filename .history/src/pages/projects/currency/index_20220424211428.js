              <p>
                Currency is the official design system of{" "}
                <a href="https://mtb.com">M&amp;T Bank</a>, used by numerous
                design and engineering teams. It is comprised of three parts,
                the Figma component library, the codebase, and the documentation
                standalone site.
              </p>
              <p>
                I joined the bank's Customer Experience Design team in 2019 as
                the second UX Engineer on the Design System team. For the last 3
                years, my focus at M&amp;T has been on building Currency from
                the ground up and continuing to grow it, as the company
                considers it as its own product.

                  I'm currently leading the engineering efforts of Currency,
                  including managing the front-end technology stack, development
                  standards and conventions, approving all pull requests, and
                  responsible for all releases and updates.

              <h3>Designer:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During its inception, the team was small, so I filled the
                  designer role for several components, as well as fully
                  building the documentation site from scratch.

                  As a member of the UX team, I am involved in any discussions
                  regarding the design of components and providing guidance on
                  how they are used.

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The need for a design system is widely known now, almost to the
              point of being a new buzzword in the industry, but it was only a
              few years ago that we had to really prove to stakeholders and
              executives the actual value of having one. Design systems simply
              provide consistency, efficiency, and uniformity across a brand.
              Being a UX Engineer, this concept deeply intrigued me as I was
              always the one bridging the gap between engineering and design,
              and a design system in essence is a personification of my role at
              most companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design systems remove, or at the very least, migitate the need for
              engineers to go through a design review process in which each
              detail and pixel is examined to see if it matches the design that
              was originally delivered. In fact, this extends even to design
              teams themselvesâ€”it ensures that any component or element used by
              one designer is identical to those used by another.
            </p>
            <p>
              This concept is not new nor unique to what is branded as a "design
              system". It existed in Sketch as Symbols for quite some time, and
              even moreso in front-end engineering as Components. A design
              system takes this principle of consistency and reusability and
              amplifies it across every aspect of the product as an umbrella of
              uniformity.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <h3>In the beginning</h3>
            <p>
              When I first joined, the design system simply did not exist, as I
              was part of the team responsible for creating it from scratch. At
              this time, design systems were a relatively new topic just
              starting to gain popularity. There were only a handful of public
              design systems that we were able to learn and study from, such as
              Shopify's Polaris.
            </p>
            <p>
              My team and I were sent to Clarity in NYC, a design systems
              convention dedicated to guiding and teaching design teams about
              design systems.
