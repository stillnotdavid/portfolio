Instead of\n                playing on Valve's native matchmaking which has no guarantee of\n                quality games, users are essentially playing private games with\n                each other, made by ESEA.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I joined ESEA as a part-time contractor in 2016, with\n                redesigning the client as one of my first projects.

The star is the most iconic part of ESEA's\n                brand, so the new branding was based around the concept of\n                space. Dark, subtle colors are primarily used with strong, vivid\n                colors such as the primary green and white.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I opted for Roboto as the primary typeface for its versatility\n                as both a display and paragraph text, and its readability at all\n                sizes.\n              </p>\n              <img src={branding} />\n              <h3>Components</h3>\n              <p>\n                After researching numerous amounts of gaming UIs, I decided to\n                go for a flat design style with a touch of traditional gaming\n                accents, such as subtle gradients, transparency, and outer\n                glows. This allows for the elements to both appear modern while\n                keeping the familiarity that most players are used to seeing and\n                interacting with.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Most elements are subtle and dark, with the primary color being\n                used as accents and highlights.\n              </p>\n              <img src={components} />\n              <h3>Backgrounds and Imagery</h3>\n              <p>\n                The two primary types of imagery used throughout the new\n                branding revolves around the concept of space, and metals to\n                reflect the guns in Counter-Strike. Therefore, carbon fiber is\n                often the pattern of choice for its sleek and elegant texture,\n                and galaxies are used to depict the vastness of space on larger\n                backgrounds.\n              </p>\n              <img src={backgrounds} />\n            </section>\n            <section>\n              <h2>The New Home Screen</h2>\n              <p>\n                I kept the core components of the home screen in the same place\n                for familiarity, changing only the overall look of the UI into\n                something more visually appealing and modern.\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Following normal design conventions, the logo is prominent in\n                  the top left at all times, reinforcing the branding of ESEA.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The top level navigation replaces the old tabs, allowing for\n                  easy access between the different functions of the client.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The new sidebar is more intuititve and informational,\n                  displaying all of the user's personal data, including the new\n                  buddy list.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The main function of the client remains the most prominent\n                  element.

It's useful to know if a player is idle or away from\n                their keyboard, so that they are not invited to a party or\n                lobby. The green, orange, and red colors are a convention used\n                by almost every chat platform denoting Available, Away, and\n                Busy. Because these colors have instrisic meaning, they cannot\n                be overrided by a skin.\n                <p>\n                  I experimented with a few fun aways to display and animate the\n                  options of getting the status.\n                </p>\n              </p>\n              <img src={status} />\n              <h3>New Buddy List</h3>\n              <p>\n                Since player status was now available, each buddy now has a\n                status bubble on their avatar (which is pulled from their site\n                profile). On top of idle status, behavioral status is also a new\n                bit of information that is available, as the client is able to\n                track the player's game status, displaying whether or not they\n                are playing actively Counter-Strike, presently inside of an ESEA\n                lobby, or simply available at their computer.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I also experimented with two variations of the buddy list, one\n                in which Online and Offline players are grouped seperately.\n              </p>\n              <img src={buddyList} />\n              <h3>Achievements</h3>\n              <p>\n                The concept of achievements is nothing new to video\n                games—players getting rewarded for completing a task has been\n                the foundation of every video game since the beginning of time.\n                Although the client itself is not a video game, we brought this\n                reward system to gamify the experience, allowing users to\n                receive rewards such as skins for ranking up.\n              </p>\n              <img src={achievements} />\n              <p>\n                This is technically possible because the client's backend is\n                connected to the website, allowing for users to receive items or\n                awards through posting, ranking up, and participating in events.\n              </p>\n              <h3>Skins</h3>\n              <p>\n                One of the most exciting new features for users is skins.
