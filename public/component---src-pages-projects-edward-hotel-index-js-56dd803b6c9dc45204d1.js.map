The website serves primarily as an\n                informational portal for customers to browse and book a hotel\n                room online.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I took on this project as both the designer and developer.\n                Working closely with the client and an additional Content\n                Writer, I was able to take the site from start to finish and\n                launched within three weeks.\n              </p>\n              <a\n                className=\"button button--secondary\"\n                href=\"http://theedwardbuffalo.com\"\n              >\n                Visit Live Site\n              </a>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"project__role\">\n              <h2>My Roles</h2>\n              <h3>Designer:</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Without any previous guidelines, I was given full creative\n                  freedom to rebrand their beautiful hotel's digital presence.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  The new website was redesigned from scratch without any\n                  requirements of keeping traces of the old site.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n              <h3>Developer:</h3>\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  After the consultation, we decided to forsake a CMS and opted\n                  to use GatsbyJS for React's features, snappy load times, and\n                  versatility.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  While it is a small site, I built the front-end using\n                  system-based components and an advanced SCSS architecture to\n                  ensure that it could scale if ever necessary.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project__body\">\n            <section className=\"before-after\">\n              <h2>Before &amp; After</h2>\n              <SimpleReactLightbox>\n                <SRLWrapper>\n                  <img className=\"before-after__image\" src={before} />\n                  <img className=\"before-after__image\" src={after} />\n                </SRLWrapper>\n              </SimpleReactLightbox>\n            </section>\n            <div className=\"grid\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>\n                <p>\n                  The major problem the client had with the current website was\n                  that it did not look <strong>modern or professional</strong>{\" \"}\n                  enough. This would naturally be solved in a redesign, as from\n                  a design standpoint, it is the most straight forward problem\n                  to solve. However:\n                </p>\n\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    The concept of modernizing something seems very intrisical\n                    to designers, but the perception of 'modern' can be\n                    subjective. It's important to be aware of the target\n                    audience, and also the client themselves, whom in this\n                    specific scenario are well-versed in interior design and\n                    architecture. To understand the client's idea of 'modern'\n                    and 'professional', I asked them to show me examples of\n                    other hotel websites that they thought fits this\n                    description.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Because there weren't any branding guidelines to go off of,\n                    the visual language of the new site would have to be built\n                    entirely from scratch, which comes with both a lot of\n                    creative freedom and new challenges, since the new branding\n                    would have to properly reflect the hotel's historical,\n                    luxurious feel while fulfilling the requirement of being\n                    modern.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    While invisible on the surface, Wix's sitebuilder can be\n                    clunky, causing higher than optimal load times, which in\n                    turn creates a more dated experience for users, as well as\n                    some SEO issues. An upgrade in technology can certainly add\n                    to the feeling of 'professional' and 'modern'.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Professionalism in visual design is almost always correlated\n                    to proper use of basic design theory concepts, something the\n                    original website was undoubtedly lacking.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </section>\n              <section>\n                <h2>Challenges</h2>\n                <ol>\n                  <li>\n                    Content is of course the most important part of an\n                    informational website, and well-written copy is crucial in\n                    building trust and communicating with users. The old copy\n                    was very unprofessional and the language was inconsistent\n                    across the board. To address this, I suggested bringing in a\n                    professional content writer to help us revamp all the copy\n                    on every page.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    The new branding has to look modern in the digital space,\n                    while maintaining some sort tie to the hotel's own signature\n                    look in person. Fortunately, because the client had so many\n                    high quality photos of the hotel, this was much easier to\n                    accomplish.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Because the new website is so rich in photography, a\n                    traditional static HTML and CSS site would not only be\n                    difficult to build efficiently, but performance would be a\n                    huge issue. To address this, I opted to use React,\n                    specifically GatsbyJS, a static site generator, to take\n                    advantage of image processing packages such as Sharp that\n                    would help with performance and buildability. Addtiionally,\n                    without a backend, security issues are no longer a concern.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    The hotel uses an external booking software that syncs\n                    calendars across other booking sites such as Expedia. This\n                    is ultimately the biggest barrier, as we have no control\n                    over the actual booking experience of the user. The best we\n                    could do would be sending the user off to the third-party\n                    site feeling satisfied and confident enough to successfully\n                    book a room.\n                  </li>\n                </ol>\n              </section>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"grid\">\n              <section>\n                <h2>Objectives</h2>\n                <p>\n                  Make the site feel more modern and professional. It sounds\n                  simple, but there are many factors and layers to this goal.\n                </p>\n                <ol>\n                  <li>\n                    First and foremost: improve the usability, information\n                    architecture, and navigation of the site.

For\n                  users who have premediated goals of booking, the Book Now\n                  button remains at the top level navigation, which is fixed on\n                  every page.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  Private Events was condensed into a smaller component sitting\n                  on the homepage, as it does not have enough content to warrant\n                  its own page.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </section>\n            <section>\n              <h2>New Visual Design</h2>\n              <img src={visuals} />\n              <div className=\"grid\">\n                <div>\n                  <h3>Logo</h3>\n                  <p>\n                    Because the budget did not allow for a new logo design (and\n                    I am not a logo designer), I simply revamped it to appear\n                    fit the new design style, changing the typeface to Avenir\n                    Next Condensed, a more visually appealing and modern\n                    apporach. I also changed the decorative line on the left to\n                    the new primary gold color, giving it a nice accent. An\n                    alternative horizontal logo was made for instances where the\n                    responsiveness of the site makes the stacked logo too small\n                    to view.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <h3>Typography</h3>\n                  <p>\n                    One of the Edward's most notable charactistics is that it\n                    combines a historical, classic look with a modernized\n                    approach to the hotel experience. To reflect this, I paired\n                    Lora with Noto Sans—both Google Fonts, which improves\n                    performance thanks to CDN caching. The elegant serifs in\n                    Lora that is primarily used for contextual content, such as\n                    paragraph texts and titles, showcases the hotel's timeless\n                    classical design. For user-interactive content, such as\n                    buttons, navigations, forms, and text fields, Noto Sans\n                    provides a sleek modern touch, reflecting the hotel's modern\n                    approach at how it handles bookings and check-in's.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <h3>Color</h3>\n                  <p>\n                    The new primary brand color is a sharp gold, slightly\n                    different from the previous yellow, which reflects the\n                    luxuriousness of the hotel when paired on black. This is\n                    used sparingly throughout the site, for accents or\n                    highlights and CTAs. The secondary colors are all subtle,\n                    muted palettes found in the rooms of the actual hotel rooms.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <h3>Form</h3>\n                  <p>\n                    The new redesign uses geometric shapes with sharp edges to\n                    create a sleek, modern, yet classic look that reflects the\n                    visuals of the hotel. The overlaying shapes and elements not\n                    only parallel the craftsmanship of the interior design, but\n                    feels modern and professional in the digital space.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </section>\n            <section>\n              <h2>New Features</h2>\n              <h3>Find Room Component</h3>\n              <p>\n                One of the most prominent additions to the new website is the\n                ability to find a room from the current webpage. Bookings are\n                100% handled on an external third-party website, but previously\n                users had to also find rooms on the third-party site as well.\n                This new Find Rooms component allows users to do all the\n                browsing on the hotel website before being sent off.\n              </p>\n              <img src={findRooms} />\n              <p>\n                This is technically possible because the room searching\n                parameters are located in the URL of the third-party site. I was\n                able to utilize AirBnb's calendar picker component to\n                dynamically generate a link with the desired search parameters,\n                ensuring that users stay on the main website for as long as\n                possible. By default, the current dates are automatically\n                populated via MomentJS.\n              </p>\n              <img src={code} />\n            </section>\n            <h3>New Rooms Page</h3>\n            <p>\n              Perhaps the most important part of the new website is the rooms\n              page, which sells the customer on the product—in this case, a\n              hotel room. Prior to the redesign, the only way for the user to\n              see the rooms that the hotel had to offer was through the\n              third-party site. The issues that came with this were that the\n              photos were low quality, not enticing, the amenities were\n              inconsistent and inaccurate, and the information was difficult to\n              control.\n            </p>\n            <img src={newRooms} />\n            <p>\n              I used the hotel's stunning visuals to draw attention to each room\n              through a manual carousel, and added all the information on each\n              room below. This way, we had full control over what the user could\n              see before sending them off to the booking site, which is\n              conveniently available in every room component.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The component itself processes all the images through Sharp via a\n              GraphQL query to fully optimize quality and size. I also took\n              advantage of lazy loading the images to increase the perception of\n              speed. Images only load when they are called through the\n              carousel—that is, unless all the currently fetched images are\n              already loaded.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Because there are so many hotel rooms and each room had at least 4\n              very high quality images, this component made it possible to\n              showcase them all without sacrificing too much performance.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The rooms are ordered in descending order of what is most enticing\n              visually and what is better for the hotel.\n            </p>\n            <h3>New Gallery Page</h3>\n            <p>\n              This page did not exist on the old site, but is crucial to the\n              experience of the new redesign, which heavily focuses on visuals\n              to draw in the customer. The client had an abundance of beautiful\n              photos already taken, so I took full advantage of them by\n              showcasing them all in a single location. The hotel itself prides\n              itself in its modern renovations and beautiful interior design,\n              and a gallery to showcase it brought the client a great sense of\n              pride.\n            </p>\n            <img src={gallery} />\n            <p>\n              Because this page has even more photos than the Rooms page, Sharp\n              was once again necessary to optimize the size and quality of the\n              photos depending on where it was being loaded. I also utilized a\n              lightbox plugin to allow users to browse through the photos in a\n              slideshow style.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Home Page Portal</h3>\n            <p>\n              The previous homepage was essentially useless to the user—it\n              provided no information, nor did it direct the user to any\n              destination with information. In the redesign, I treated the\n              homepage as a portal to the other main pages of the site, a normal\n              convention for most sites.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Although the top menu is visible at all times, I took advantage of\n              the vibrant imagery to direct users to where they needed to go as\n              an additional form of navigation.\n            </p>\n            <img src={portal} />\n            <p>\n              The copy for each block draws the users into wanting to learn more\n              about the hotel, and the personalized call to action entices the\n              users to click on what is already an attractive link.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>\n            <p>\n              The old site was unviewable on mobile, which is simply not\n              acceptable in the modern age. While the visuals were not as\n              prominent in the mobile view, the primary actions of booking a\n              room and exploring rooms were still the key features of the mobile\n              site.\n            </p>\n            <img src={mobile} />\n            <p>\n              The entire nav menu transforms into the mobile menu via pure CSS,\n              without any Javascript or React magic. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox,\n              rearranging the content into a mobile view was seamless and easy.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n            <p>\n              The client fell in love with the redesign from the very first\n              iteration. The new branding felt clean, sleek, modern, and\n              professional, just as they had envisioned it. The user experience\n              is straight forward and tailored around the user's discovery of\n              all the information that the hotel had to offer.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Rooms page is the client's favorite part of the site, as it\n              perfectly solved the problem they had with the previous site in\n              that it did not properly showcase what the hotel had to offer.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectPage;\n"],"names":["className","Helmet","title","src","hero","href","before","after","userflow","visuals","findRooms","code","newRooms","gallery","portal","mobile"],"sourceRoot":""}
